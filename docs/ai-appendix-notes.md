## AI tool usage approach

### 2026-09-12 — Infrastructure (PR #1)

- Strategy: gave the full case study PDF and hard process constraints (TypeScript, TDD, Conventional Commits, PR-only, SonarCloud, advisory AI review). Asked for a design before any scaffolding, approved it, then let parallel agents build disjoint parts.
- Human refinement: rejected required human approval in branch protection (owner cannot approve own PRs) in favour of a label-and-comment protocol; asked for coverage to be enforced at commit time instead of a paid SonarCloud gate; asked for the original Form 5 docx instead of a Markdown rewrite.

## Judgement, challenges and verification

### 2026-09-12 — `local-gates` check masked its own failure (PR #1)

- Challenge: the first version of the label-gating job swallowed a failed label removal with `|| true`, so a stale "verified" label could have covered new commits. It also re-ran the full CI job on every label event.
- Verification: caught by the `impact-analyzer` agent run before push, which traced the workflow event flow and the token permissions.
- Resolution: moved the job to its own workflow, removed the mask, serialised runs per PR, and added the check to branch protection.

## Overall reflection

- Estimated ratio: pending.
- Key takeaway: pending.
